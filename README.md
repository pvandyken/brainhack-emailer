# ( ‚óï‚ó°‚óï)„Å£ Cloudflare Workers Google OAuth

This is a companion repository for the blog post at [Apiumhub :: Tech blog](https://apiumhub.com/tech-blog-barcelona/implementing-google-oauth-google-api-cloudflare-workers/).

In the blog post, we go though the code that OAuth-s a user and uses a Google API for that user.
We'll be developing this app that lists, based on a query, the files in that user's Google Drive. Like so:

A more detail explanation of how Google Sign in should behave can be found in Google's docs: [Using OAuth 2.0 for Web Server Applications](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server).

## Requirements

- [wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/install-update) 1.17 or newer.
- A [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com).
- A Google Services account
  - With the API you wish to consume enabled. e.g: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/drive.googleapis.com/overview
  - A Google OAuth Client ID and Secret, from the [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) > + Create credentials > Oauh client ID. _Note: "Authorized redirect URIs" should have your cloudflare worker url with `/auth` at the end, and optionaly `http://127.0.0.1:8787/auth` to work locally.

### Setup wrangler

1. Clone this template: `wrangler generate [a name] https://github.com/jazcarate/cloudflare-worker-google-oauth`.
1. Update the worker's secrets with the ones generated by creating the `Credentials` in the Google Service Account:
   - `wrangler secret put CLIENT_ID [your client id]`
   - `wrangler secret put CLIENT_SECRET [your client secret]`
1. Create a `KV` namespace: `wrangler kv:namespace create "authTokens"` and update the `wrangler.toml` accordingly.

## Ideas to grow this project
If you would like to use this setups as a starting point to develop interesting things; I recommend trying out one (or all!) of this improvements:

- Create a middleware pattern to deaal with authenticated and unauthenticated endpoints
- Serve static content, either with Cloudflare Sites, or reading local files in a Worker. A default path could be implemented to serve files in `public/` folder.
- Improve the rendered HTML with a template library, or roll up your own!
- Use another Google API from [the list](https://developers.google.com/workspace/products).


## Glossary
Throughout this project there are two somewhat similar, but distincts concepts:
 - Google's `code`: Is a one time code that is quickly exchanged with Google for a `token` üëá.
 - `token`: Is the authentication method for Google.
 - `auth`: Is the authentication method for this Worker.

The app deals with both, in very different ways; and it is the `KV` that provides a one way transformation between `auth` to `token`.
 
## Contributing
If you think that you can improve the code, or the explanation; feel free to drop a pull request or a comment; but please keep in mind that the purpose of this is educational.

## Developing
Once the requirements are fulfilled, simply run `npm run dev`.

The server will default to running at [127.0.0.1:8787](http://127.0.0.1:8787/).

## Testing
Rn `npm test` for jest tests.

## Publishing
Run `npm run publish` to lint, build and publish to your Cloudflare Worker!

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Caveats

Some ü™Ñ wizardry was implemented to know if the code was running locally (with `wrangler dev`) or in the cloud; as `wrangler dev` reweites the `request.url` to always match the environment.
